# Apple Quality Prediction - Jovs / CS Elective 4
Made for my  Data Science Portfolio Project requirement.

A machine learning project to classify apple quality ('good' or 'bad') based on a set of physical and chemical attributes. This project was developed as a data science portfolio piece to demonstrate a complete workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

## üéØ About The Project

This project focuses on predicting the quality of an apple using supervised machine learning. Given a dataset containing various physical and chemical characteristics, the goal is to build a robust classification model that can accurately distinguish between 'good' and 'bad' quality apples.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Data preprocessing for modeling
- Training and comparing multiple classification models
- Evaluating model performance to select the best one

## üçé Dataset

The data for this project is the **Apple Quality Dataset**. It contains 4,000 observations with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Size` | The size of the fruit. |
| `Weight` | The weight of the fruit. |
| `Sweetness` | The degree of sweetness of the fruit. |
| `Crunchiness`| A texture metric indicating the crunchiness of the fruit. |
| `Juiciness` | The level of juiciness of the fruit. |
| `Ripeness` | The stage of ripeness of the fruit. |
| `Acidity` | The acidity level of the fruit. |
| `Quality` | **Target Variable**: Overall quality (`good` or `bad`). |
