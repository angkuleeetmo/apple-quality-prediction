# Apple Quality Prediction
Made for my  Data Science Portfolio Project requirement.

A machine learning project to classify apple quality ('good' or 'bad') based on a set of physical and chemical attributes. This project was developed as a data science portfolio piece to demonstrate a complete workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

### Key Objectives & Process

The project follows a structured approach to solve this classification problem:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and key characteristics of the apples.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling the target variable and splitting the data.
3.  **Model Building:** Train and compare several classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to find the most effective predictor.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assess the models using key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to select the best one for the task.
